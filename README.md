Twisted Web extension
=====================

   A routing extension to twisted.web.


Purpose & History
======

This project started a few months around when Klein did and if you want
a more complete web framework I would recommend that over txWeb.

TxWeb has been drastically refactored to provide a Twisted Web Resource 
a long with a few other utilities to mimic the original pylons as well
as another interpretation of Flask's blueprints
